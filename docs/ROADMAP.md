# Voicing Lab Roadmap

**Last Updated:** December 2025  
**Current Focus:** Phase 4 - Playground Mode v2

This roadmap tracks feature development status. Feature numbers (F1.1, F2.1, etc.) match the specifications in [DESIGN_DOC.md](DESIGN_DOC.md).

---

## Now (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026) ✅

**Phase 4: Playground Mode v2** - Simplified to focus on voicing construction. Enharmonic display implemented.

### F4: Playground Mode v2

- [ ] **F4.1** - Hand Mode Toggle (Single | Two) ⏸️ DEFERRED
  - Removed from Playground Mode
  - Will be introduced in later phases where functionally necessary

- [ ] **F4.2** - Single-Hand Presets (Triads + 7th Inversions) ⏸️ DEFERRED
  - Removed from Playground Mode
  - Practice mode feature for future phase

- [ ] **F4.3** - Two-Hand Divider (Fixed, Snap-to-Block) ⏸️ DEFERRED
  - Removed from Playground Mode
  - Will be introduced with Melody-on-Top or Practice Mode

- [x] **F4.4** - Enharmonic Chord Symbol Display ✅
  - Display Bb instead of A# in chord symbols
  - Keep internal representation sharps-only
  - COMPLETED December 2025

**Phase 4 Update (December 2025):**
Hand context features (F4.1-F4.3) have been removed from Playground Mode to simplify the learning experience. Playground now focuses purely on voicing construction (which notes, what order). Hand assignment will be introduced in later phases where it's functionally necessary:
- Decision Tree: Passive color zones (Phase 7)
- Melody-on-Top: Automatic split based on 1-octave rule (Phase 8)
- Practice Mode: Explicit hand positions + fingering (Phase 9+)

**Status:** Simplified December 2025 ✅

## Next (Jan - Feb 2026) 📋

After completing extensions, focus shifts to intelligent pattern recognition to help users discover jazz vocabulary.

### F6: Context-Aware Recognition

- [ ] **F6.1** - Voicing Pattern Detection Algorithm
  - `detectVoicingPattern()` function
  - Pattern matching against known voicing library
  - Real-time detection as user drags blocks

- [ ] **F6.2** - Pattern Library (Shell A/B, Drop-2, Rootless, Inversions)
  - Define recognizable patterns with metadata
  - Include descriptions, "why it works", common use
  - Cover: shells, rootless, drop-2, inversions, slash chords

- [ ] **F6.3** - Insight Card UI ("You found a Drop-2!")
  - Non-intrusive card/tooltip
  - Shows pattern name + explanation
  - Dismissible without disrupting workflow

- [ ] **F6.4** - Educational Explanations & Tips
  - Context-sensitive learning content
  - "Why this works" explanations
  - "When to use" recommendations

**Value:** HIGH - Connects user exploration to jazz vocabulary. Discovery-based learning is more engaging than lecture.

**Estimated Duration:** 1 week

---

## Later (Feb - Apr 2026) 📅

The Decision Tree Navigator is the "killer feature" - teaches voice leading through interactive decision-making.

### F7: Decision Tree Navigator

- [ ] **F7.1** - Decision Tree Data Structure
  - `DecisionNode` and `VoicingOption` types
  - Build tree for ii-V-I with template voicings
  - Navigation state management (back, start over)

- [ ] **F7.2** - Voice Leading Analysis Algorithm
  - Analyze common tones, half-steps, whole-steps
  - Calculate smoothness score (0-100)
  - Generate explanations ("C→B is smooth half-step")

- [ ] **F7.3** - Hover-to-Preview Interaction
  - Preview keyboard appears on hover (faded)
  - Shows future voicing before committing
  - Smooth animations

- [ ] **F7.4** - Voice Movement Arrows
  - SVG arrows showing note movement
  - Color-coded by interval type:
    - Green = common tone (stays)
    - Blue = half-step (smooth)
    - Yellow = whole-step (medium)
    - Red = large interval (dramatic)
  - Animated drawing effect

- [ ] **F7.5** - Smoothness Score & Explanations
  - Display score for each option
  - Explain why option is smooth/dramatic
  - Recommendation level (best/good/alternative)

**Scope:** Template voicings only (not playground custom voicings)

**Value:** This is the unique pedagogical feature. No other tool teaches voice leading through interactive decision-making.

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 weeks

### F5: Extensions in Playground

Completed: January 2026 (UI Redesign: December 2024)

- [x] **F5.1** - Multi-State Extension Blocks (Off → 9 → ♭9 → ♯9) ✅
  - Click to cycle through states
  - Enforces mutual exclusivity (can't have 9 and ♭9 simultaneously)
  - States cycle based on extension family
  - All variants available regardless of current selection

- [x] **F5.2** - Unified Note Selector UI ✅
  - Separate selector area for choosing notes (R-3-5-7-9-11-13)
  - Fixed sequential order, never reordered
  - State indicator dots only on extensions (not chord tones)
  - Unified drag area for enabled notes with X button removal

- [x] **F5.3** - Extension Integration with Presets ✅
  - Shell A+9 preset added
  - Shell Altered (1-3-7-♭9-♯11) for V7 added
  - Rootless presets include 9ths by default
  - Presets don't affect selector display order

**Value:** Extensions are core to jazz sound. Without 9ths, voicings sound sparse.

**UI Refinement (December 2024):**
- Redesigned with separate selector and drag areas
- Fixed extension cycling bug (state persistence + variant availability)
- Selector always shows R-3-5-7-9-11-13 in fixed order
- Chord tones toggle on/off, extensions cycle through alterations

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Features | Timeline | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| Phase 1 | F1.1-F1.4 (Foundation) | Completed | ✅ |
| Phase 2 | F2.1-F2.4 (Template Mode) | Completed | ✅ |
| Phase 3 | F3.1-F3.6 (Playground v1) | Completed | ✅ |
| Phase 4 | F4.1-F4.4 (Playground v2) | Completed | ✅ |
| Phase 5 | F5.1-F5.3 (Extensions) | Completed | ✅ |
| **Phase 6** | **F6.1-F6.4 (Recognition)** | **Jan-Feb 2026** | **📋 Next** |
| Phase 7 | F7.1-F7.5 (Decision Tree) | Feb-Apr 2026 | 📅 Later |
| Phase 8 | F8.1-F8.5 (Advanced) | TBD | 💡 Ideas |

**Total Estimated Time to Decision Tree:** 8-10 weeks from now

---

## Priority Rationale

### Why This Order?

1. **Phase 4 First (Hand Mode)**: Foundational for learning chord shapes. Single-hand inversions are prerequisites to understanding shells/rootless.

2. **Phase 5 Complete (Extensions)**: Extensions are now integrated. Rootless voicings include 9ths by default. Users can cycle through alterations (♭9, ♯9, ♯11, ♭13) to explore jazz harmony.

3. **Phase 6 Before Phase 7 (Recognition)**: Low-effort, high-value feature. Provides immediate pedagogical feedback. Builds excitement for Decision Tree.

4. **Phase 7 Last (Decision Tree)**: Most complex feature, requires 3-4 weeks. This is the "killer feature" that teaches voice leading through interactive decision-making.

5. **Phase 8 Deferred (Future Ideas)**: Nice-to-have features that don't block core learning objectives. Melody Lock, Slash Chords, and Context Toggle add complexity without proportional pedagogical value at this stage.
